# Substitution Matrices

A CRUD for Substitution Matrices (like PAM240, BLOSUM62, etc.) commonly used in bioinformatics and evolutionary biology.

This has been built by ZENODE within the Hardhat environment and is licensed under the MIT-license (see [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md)).

## TL;DR

`1. Installation` <i>--use npm, yarn or any other package manager.</i>

```
npm install
```
```
yarn install
```

`2. Run the test node` <i>--do this in a separate terminal!</i>

```script
npx hardhat node
```

`3. Deployment`

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

`4. Contract address` <i>--add to [zenode.config.js](\zenode.config.js)</i>

```javascript
	...
	contracts: {
		substitutionMatrices: {
			name: "SubstitutionMatrices",
			address: "ADD_YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE",
		},
	},
	...
```

`5. Population`

```
npx run scripts/alphabets/insert.js
npx run scripts/matrices/insert.js
```

`6. Interaction` <i>--use the scripts provided in the [Interaction phase](#6-interaction).</i>

## Dependencies

- `hardhat` (npm module)
- `web3` (npm module)
- Uses the [`zenode-helpers`](/submodules/zenode-helpers) repository, which is automatically included as a Git submodule.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

To get started, install all dependencies using a package manager of your choosing:

```
npm install
```

```
yarn install
```

### 2. Configure and run your (test) node

After having installed all dependencies use:

```script
npx hardhat node
```

`NOTE: Make sure to do this in a separate terminal!`
<br>
<br>
This will create a test environment where we can deploy our contract(s) to. By default, this repository is configured to Hardhat's local test node, but can be changed in the [hardhat.config.js](/hardhat.config.js) file. For more information on how to do this, see [Hardhat's documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config).

### 3. Deploy

Now that are node is up-and-running, we can now deploy our contract using:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

If all went well, you should see a message appear in your terminal, stating that the contract was deployed successfully.

### 4. [zenode.config.js](/zenode.config.js)

This is where most of the <i>personalization</i> for contract deployment and filling takes place. In the case of the `SubstitutionMatrices` contract this means:

- You can choose which alphabets/matrices get inserted or deleted in the `Population` phase.
- You can configure which contract we'll interact with in the `Interaction` phase.
- You can expand (or shrink for that matter) the list of known alphabets or matrices.

#### 4.1 Configuration

Before populating our freshly deployed CRUD, we'll first have to make a couple changes to our [zenode.config.js](/zenode.config.js) file.

##### 4.1.1 Link contract address (required)

To know where we have to insert our alphabets and matrices, we'll have to add the address of our deployed contract to the `contracts` object.

```javascript
	...
	contracts: {
		substitutionMatrices: {
			name: "SubstitutionMatrices",
			address: "ADD_YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE",
		},
	},
	...
```

`NOTE: The contract address can be found in your terminal after deployment.`
<br>

##### 4.1.2 Editing insertions/deletions (Optional)

By default, all (known) alphabets and matrices will be inserted upon running the `insert.js` script (`Population` phase). If you would like to change this, you could. Just edit the following key-value pairs:

```javascript
	{
		// You could also pass in a string instead of an array
		alphabetsToInsert: ["ALPHABET_ID_1", "ALPHABET_ID_2", ...],
		matricesToInsert: ["MATRIX_ID_1", "MATRIX_ID_2", ...],
	}
```

For the `delete.js` script:

```javascript
	{
		alphabetsToDelete: ["ALPHABET_ID_1", "ALPHABET_ID_2", ...],
		matricesToDelete: ["MATRIX_ID_1", "MATRIX_ID_2", ...],
	}
```

`NOTE: The IDs are only valid if they are 'keys' found in the 'alphabets' and 'matrices' objects (more about this in the next sub-section).`

##### 4.1.3 Creating new alphabets/matrices (Optional)

...

### 5 Population

Now that we've deployed our contract and configured our setup, we can now start populating our CRUD with alphabets and matrices!

#### 5.1 Alphabets

To insert all the alphabets you've configured in the key-value pair `alphabetsToInsert` use:

```
npx run scripts/alphabets/insert.js
```

#### 5.2 Matrices

To insert all the matrices you've configured in the key-value pair `matricesToInsert` use:

```
npx run scripts/matrices/insert.js
```

`NOTE: you can't insert a matrix before inserting the alphabet it belongs to!`

## Appendix

### A. Alphabets and Matrices

Alphabets and Matrices are the two main components in the `SubstitutionMatrices` contract. `Alphabets` (currently) being: `nucleotide or protein sequence characters` (e.g. C, T, A and G) and `Matrices`: `2-dimensional grids` (e.g. BLOSUM62, PAM40, PAM120, etc.). To gain a better understanding on how this looks like, you could check out the alphabets and matrices included in this repository (in the [datasets](/datasets)-folder).

They are simple .txt-files in the following format:

- An `alphabet` is a single line of characters, delimited by whitespaces. Mind you that <b>the order of the characters is important</b> as their position represents their numeric value in the contract.

2. A `matrix` is a 2-dimensional grid, where the row- and column names are characters from their respective alphabet. <b>Again, the order of the characters is important and should be the same as the corresponding alphabet!</b>
