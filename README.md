# Substitution Matrices

A CRUD for Substitution Matrices (like PAM240, BLOSUM62, etc.) commonly used in bioinformatics and evolutionary biology.

## Dependencies

- `hardhat` (npm module)
- `web3` (npm module)
- Uses the [`zenode-helpers`](/submodules/zenode-helpers) repository, which is automatically included as a Git submodule.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

To get started, install all dependencies using a package manager of your choosing:

```
npm install
```

```
yarn install
```

### 2. Configure and run your (test) node

After having installed all dependencies use:

```script
npx hardhat node
```

`NOTE: Make sure to do this in a separate terminal!`
<br>
<br>
This will create a test environment where we can deploy our contract(s) to. By default, this repository is configured to Hardhat's local test node, but can be changed in the [hardhat.config.js](/hardhat.config.js) file. For more information on how to do this, see [Hardhat's documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config).

### 3. Deployment

Now that our node is up-and-running, we can deploy our contract using:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

If all went well, you should see a message appear in your terminal, stating that the contract was deployed successfully.

### 4. Configuration

Before populating our freshly deployed CRUD, we'll first have to make a couple changes to our [zenode.config.js](/zenode.config.js) file ([learn more](#b-zenodeconfigjs)).

#### 4.1 Link contract address (required)

To know where we have to insert our alphabets and matrices, we'll have to add the address of our deployed contract to the `contracts` object.

```javascript
	...
	contracts: {
		substitutionMatrices: {
			name: "SubstitutionMatrices",
			address: "ADD_YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE",
		},
	},
	...
```

`NOTE: The contract address can be found in your terminal after deployment.`
<br>

#### 4.2 Editing insertions/deletions (Optional)

By default, all (known) alphabets and matrices will be inserted upon running the `insert.js` script (`Population` phase). If you would like to change this, you could. Just edit the following key-value pairs:

```javascript
	{
		// You could also pass in a string instead of an array
		alphabetsToInsert: ["ALPHABET_ID_1", "ALPHABET_ID_2", ...],
		matricesToInsert: ["MATRIX_ID_1", "MATRIX_ID_2", ...],
	}
```

For the `delete.js` script:

```javascript
	{
		alphabetsToDelete: ["ALPHABET_ID_1", "ALPHABET_ID_2", ...],
		matricesToDelete: ["MATRIX_ID_1", "MATRIX_ID_2", ...],
	}
```

`NOTE: The IDs are only valid if they are 'keys' found in the 'alphabets' and 'matrices' objects (more about this in the next sub-section).`

#### 4.3 Creating new alphabets/matrices (Optional)

...

### 5. Population

Now that we've deployed our contract and configured our setup, we can start populating our CRUD with alphabets and matrices!

#### 5.1 Alphabets

To insert all the alphabets you've configured in the key-value pair `alphabetsToInsert` use:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/alphabets/insert.js
```

#### 5.2 Matrices

To insert all the matrices you've configured in the key-value pair `matricesToInsert` use:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/matrices/insert.js
```

`NOTE: you can't insert a matrix before inserting the alphabet it belongs to!`

### 6. Interaction

Deployed, populated and ready to explore! Here are a few Hardhat tasks (written in [hardhat.config.js](\hardhat.config.js)) to test our contract with:

<ul>
<li>

`getScore`
output: int <i>--value represents the score of two characters in the substitution matrix</i>

```
npx hardhat getScore --matrix "MATRIX_ID" --a "SINGLE_CHAR_A" --b "SINGLE_CHAR_B"
```

</li>

<li>

`getAlphabet`
output: struct Alphabet <i>--see [libraries/Structs.sol](/libraries/Structs.sol)</i>

```
npx hardhat getAlphabet --id "ALPHABET_ID"
```

</li>
<li>

`getMatrix`
output: struct Matrix <i>--see [libraries/Structs.sol](/libraries/Structs.sol)</i>

```
npx hardhat getMatrix --id "MATRIX_ID"
```

</li>
<li>

`getAlphabets`
output: string[]

```
npx hardhat getAlphabets
```

</li>
<li>

`getMatrices`
output: string[]

```
npx hardhat getMatrices
```

</li>
</ul>

## Appendix

### A. Alphabets and Matrices

Alphabets and Matrices are the two main components in the `SubstitutionMatrices` contract. `Alphabets` (currently) being: `nucleotide or protein sequence characters` (e.g. C, T, A and G) and `Matrices`: `2-dimensional grids` (e.g. BLOSUM62, PAM40, PAM120, etc.). To gain a better visual understanding, check out the alphabets and matrices included in the [datasets](/datasets)-folder.

They are simple .txt-files abiding by the following formatting rules:

- An `alphabet` is a single line of characters, delimited by whitespaces. Mind you that <b>the order of the characters is important</b> as their position represents their numeric value in the contract.

- A `matrix` is a 2-dimensional grid, where the first row and first column are alphabetical characters. The remaining positions in the grid are integers (zero, negative or positive). <b>Again, the order of the alphabetical characters is important and should be the same as the corresponding alphabet!</b>

### B. [zenode.config.js](/zenode.config.js)

This is where most of the <i>personalization</i> for contract deployment and filling takes place. In the case of the `SubstitutionMatrices` contract this includes:

- Choosing which alphabets/matrices get inserted or deleted in the `Population` phase.
- Configuring which contract we'll interact with in the `Interaction` phase.
- Expanding (or shrinking for that matter) the list of known alphabets and matrices.
