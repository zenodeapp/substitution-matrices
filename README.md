# Substitution Matrices

## Introduction
A CRUD for Substitution Matrices (like PAM240, BLOSUM62, etc.) commonly used in bioinformatics and evolutionary biology.

This has been built by ZENODE within the Hardhat environment and is licensed under the MIT-license (see [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md)).

## Getting Started
### 1. Installation
To get started, install all dependencies using a package manager of your choosing. For instance:
```
npm install
```
```
yarn install
```

### 2. Configure and run your (test) node
After having installed all dependencies use:
```script
npx hardhat node
```
`NOTE: Make sure to do this in a separate terminal!`
<br>
<br>
This will create a local test environment where we shall deploy our contract to. On default the network is configured to Hardhat's local node, which you can change in [hardhat.config.js](/hardhat.config.js) (for more info on this, see: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config).

### 3. Deploy 
Now after having a node up and running we'll have to deploy our contract:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
